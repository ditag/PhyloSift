- Intro
  - Evolution: the joint processes of reproduction with mutation and natural selection acting on mutations
  - Molecular evolution has left an indelible mark on microbes
  - Metagenomics, has for the first time offered a glimpse of the genetic structure of uncultured microbial communities
  - Metagenomics, in its current form, destroys some of the most valuable information present in a sample: genetic linkage.
  - Cells are shredded to get the DNA -- mixes DNA among many cells
  - Chromosomes are sheared down in to fragments palatable for sequencing instruments. Usually less than 1Kbp (though sometimes 10-20kbp). 
  - Single cell genomics can resolve this to some extent
  - Computational methods very helpful
  - Evolution provides a primary signal for read classification
    - Evolution of nucleotides/amino acids
    - Evolution of gene content

  - Previous work
    - whole-metagenome binning
      - composition classifiers
      - identity/homology classifiers
    - community composition without binning
      - AMPHORA, MLTreeMap, others?
      - MetaPHlan

  - In this work we employ phylogenetic models of nucleotide and amino acid substitution to perform metagenomic binning and community composition analysis
  - We evaluate the new method and compare it to previous approaches using simulated datasets

- Design and Implementation

  

- Discussion
  - Fundamental limits to computational methods -- resolving linkage among polymorphisms in a population
