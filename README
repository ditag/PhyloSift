AMPHORA 2

AMPHORA is an Automated Phylogenomic Inference Pipeline for bacterial sequences. From a given a set of protein sequences, it automatically identifies various phylogenetic marker genes. It then generates high-quality multiple sequence alignments for these genes and make tree-based phylotype assignments.

NEW VERSION
=============================================================
AMPHORA 2 has several new features over AMPHORA
-The number of markers is being expanded from the original 31 Bacteria only markers to many more from Archaea and Bacteria (and possibly Eukaryotes and viruses)
-HMMER 3 replaces the older, slower, HMMER 2
-Use of Pplacer from Erick Matsen to place the reads on the reference trees
-Use of BioPerl 1.6.1
-...more to come

Usage
==========================================
$ perl Amphora-2.pl <options> <sequence_file>

   sequence_file needs to be in fasta format

Options Available at this time : 
   -custom <file>      Reads a custom marker list from a file otherwise use all the markers from the markers directory
   -threaded <Number>  Runs Blast and Hmmer using the number of processors sepcified
                       Runs 1 Pplacer per processor specified
		       (DEFAULT : 1)
   -clean              Cleans the temporary files created by Amphora (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
============================================================== 
Linux OS (kernel version 2.6 or later)

The following software is required by the AMPHORA package. They need to be downloaded and installed separately from AMPHORA. 
1. Perl 5.8.8 or later (www.perl.org) 
2. Bioperl core package 1.5.2 or later  (www.bioperl.org) 
3. HMMER (hmmer.janelia.org) 
4. BLAST ()

The following software is included in the AMPHORA distribution. Their source codes have been slightly modified to suit the needs of AMPHORA. 
1. seqboot (evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip) 
2. quicktree (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/quicktree) 
3. raxml (icwww.epfl.ch/~stamatak/index-Dateien/Page443.htm)
