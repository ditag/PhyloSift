AMPHORA 2

AMPHORA is an Automated Phylogenomic Inference Pipeline for bacterial sequences. From a given a set of protein sequences, it automatically identifies various phylogenetic marker genes. It then generates high-quality multiple sequence alignments for these genes and make tree-based phylotype assignments.

NEW VERSION
=============================================================
AMPHORA 2 has several new features over AMPHORA
-The number of markers is being expanded from the original 31 Bacteria only markers to many more from Archaea and Bacteria (and possibly Eukaryotes and viruses)
-HMMER 3 replaces the older, slower, HMMER 2
-Use of Pplacer from Erick Matsen to place the reads on the reference trees
-Use of BioPerl 1.6.1
-...more to come

SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
============================================================== 
Linux OS (kernel version 2.6 or later)

The following software is required by the AMPHORA package. They need to be downloaded and installed separately from AMPHORA.

2. Bioperl core package 1.5.2 or later  (www.bioperl.org) 
3. HMMER (hmmer.janelia.org) 
4. BLAST ()

The following software is included in the AMPHORA distribution. Their source codes have been slightly modified to suit the needs of AMPHORA.
