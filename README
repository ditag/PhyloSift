AMPHORA 2

AMPHORA is an Automated Phylogenomic Inference Pipeline for bacterial sequences. From a given a set of protein sequences, it automatically identifies various phylogenetic marker genes. It then generates high-quality multiple sequence alignments for these genes and make tree-based phylotype assignments.



NEW VERSION
=============================================================
AMPHORA 2 has several new features over AMPHORA
-The number of markers is being expanded from the original 31 Bacteria only markers to many more from Archaea and Bacteria (and possibly Eukaryotes and viruses)
-HMMER 3 replaces the older, slower, HMMER 2
-Use of Pplacer from Erick Matsen to place the reads on the reference trees
-Use of BioPerl 1.6.1
-...more to come

Usage
==========================================
$ perl Amphora-2.pl <Mode> <options> <sequence_file>

   sequence_file needs to be in fasta format

$ perl Amphora-2.pl <Mode> <options> -paired <sequence_file_1> <sequence_file_2>

   sequence_file_1 and _2 need to be in fastq format

Mode : Only execute a specific step in the pipeline
  all - execute all the steps
  blast - only execute the blast + write candidate files
  align - hmmsearch + hmmalign + trims + coverage filters
  placer - run pplacer on the results from the align step
  summary - run the taxonomy assignment steps

Options Available at this time : 
   -custom <file>       Reads a custom marker list from a file otherwise use all the markers from the markers directory
   --threaded=<Number>  Runs Blast and Hmmer using the number of processors sepcified
                        Runs 1 Pplacer per processor specified
		        (DEFAULT : 1)
   -clean               Cleans the temporary files created by Amphora (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
   -paired              Looks for 2 input files (paired end sequencing) in FastQ format.  
   			Reversing the sequences for the second file listed 
			and appending to the corresponding pair from the first file listed.
   -continue            Enables the pipeline to continue to subsequent steps when not using the 'all' mode
   -reverse		If the submitted sequences were Nucleotides, the program prints out an alignment for all the markers in DNA space in addition to the one in Protein space.
