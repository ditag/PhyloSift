# configuration file for Phylosift
# this file can be edited to change the behavior of Phylosift
# and cause it to use something other than the default values for certain variables
# This can be used, for example, on a shared computing system to store a single shared copy of the 
# phylosift database or programs.
#
# The system-wide config should be copied to $PREFIX/etc/phylosiftrc, e.g. /usr/local/etc/phylosiftrc
# User-specific config files can be copied to $HOME/.phylosiftrc, e.g. /home/koadman/.phylosiftrc
# User-specific configs override values in the system-wide config.
